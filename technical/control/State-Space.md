# State-Space Control

State-Space control is a completely seperate control method, where all inputs and outputs are represended as N-dimensional matricies, and after applying one or more transformations, an output is produced. We provide some tools for working in state-space [here](/lib5k/javadoc/io/github/frc5024/lib5k/control_loops/statespace/wrappers/package-summary.html). It is strongly recommended to read @calcmogul's [paper on this topic](https://controls-in-frc.link/).
